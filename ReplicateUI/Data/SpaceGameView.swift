 🧑‍🚀 You’re building a space game. The player can choose their spaceship color — Red, Blue, or Green — from a Settings screen.
 Your mission:
 Save the selected color so when the player reopens the app, it stays the same.
 🚀 Exercise 1: Save & Load a spaceship color using UserDefaults.
 Write the Swift code for:
 Saving a string like "Red" as the selected spaceship color.
 Reading it back and printing it.
 You’re allowed to use UserDefaults.standard.
 Ready? Send me your code, and I’ll review and help you improve it!
